        <p>Generics and Enums just don&rsquo;t get along. Just reading <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79126/create-generic-method-constraining-t-to-an-enum" target="_blank">this</a> StackOverflow question and its answers shows that. I had to battle with them myself today for a bit. What I wanted to do was cast an enum to a generic parameter that while I can&rsquo;t limit to a Enum I would know was always was an Enum since it was internal. You can&rsquo;t usually cast with generics unless you have a restriction on the generic parameter and the restriction can be cast. BUT you can cast from object to the generic. So with a double cast I did it!</p>
