        <p>Yesterday I released <a href="https://github.com/SamuelEnglard/MonoGame.Js" target="_blank">MonoGame.Js</a>. As it name suggest it is MonoGame but in JavaScript. It is not writing C# code and having it run in the browser like JSIL but instead a JavaScript library that provides an API that is very much like the MonoGame API.</p>
        <p>Why did I do it? Besides my want to see MonoGame on as many platforms and in as wide use as possible, it&rsquo;s also because I believe that the API model exposed by MonoGame is so good that even if you&rsquo;re not using C# it would be helpful.</p>
        <p>Right now MonoGame.Js implements 2D graphics, and Mouse/Keyboard input. Touch input is planed though when it will be added I do not know. I have no plans to add 3D support but would be doable and if someone wants to do it in a fork I&rsquo;d be happy to take that pull request.</p>
