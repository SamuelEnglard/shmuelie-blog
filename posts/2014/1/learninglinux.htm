        <p>Well after being unemployed for a while I decided it&rsquo;s time to expand my skill set. After looking around for what skills companies where looking for a big flaw in my skill set I saw was that while I can do client side web cross browser, I only know server side from theÂ Microsoft stack (with a limited C++ and apache ability thrown in). So I decided it&rsquo;s high time I learned the LAMP stack. For those who don&rsquo;t know what LAMP is, it&rsquo;s an acronym standing for common Linux (the &ldquo;L&rdquo;) web stacks. the exact meaning of the other letters is subject to change. For me the rest will be</p>
        <p>A: Apache as the web server<br />M: MySQL for the database<br />P: Python for server side code.</p>
        <p>The thing to note about that list is that I chose precise for all letters except &ldquo;L&rdquo;. In the case of Linux I decided not to pick just one but three: Debian, Fedora, and Slackware. Each is a &ldquo;Core&rdquo; distribution that other more commonly know distributions come from. For example Ubuntu, one of the most well know and most common consumer distributions is a fork a Debian. CentOS, a popular server distribution is a fork of Fedora. By learning these three I won&rsquo;t know how to use every distribution out there but I should know the basics for each &ldquo;family&rdquo; and be able to quickly learn the differences.</p>
        <p>For the &ldquo;P&rdquo; I thought about choosing PHP, despite my extreme dislike of the language. After all, like it or not it&rsquo;s THE language to use it seems. I decided not to because learning Python would not only help me add the LAMP stack to my skill set but also all me to use it in other contexts. PHP is really only useable in LAMP (or web context that is). And admittedly it allows me to continue hating PHP.</p>
        <p>As to MySQL and Apache, I&rsquo;ve use both in the past. MySQL was part of a friends college course work and I helped her through it. Apache I used a previous job. Obviously I didn&rsquo;t really explore MySQL that much in helping my friend and at the previous job I was using the C++ integration with Apache so the skill set doesn&rsquo;t exactly transfer. On top of that most of the work I did wasn&rsquo;t with Apache but with the custom system built on top of it.</p>
        <p>So with the new year comes a new skill set and a new stack to work on. First up is learning the three Linux distributions in VMs.</p>
