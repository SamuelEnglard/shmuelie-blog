<p style="text-indent: 0.25in">“What the world really wants is to plug into a wall to get electronic power, and plug in to get data.” (Roth) “We&rsquo;re designing the OS to be fast and lightweight, to start up and get you onto the web in a few seconds.” (Pichai) Can you tell the difference between those two quotes? The two quotes are talking about two products two decades apart. The first quote is about Oracle’s Network Computer and the second quote is about Google’s Chrome OS. Despite the two-decade difference between Google’s Chrome OS and Oracle’s Network Computer, they share the concepts of no local storage, web only apps, lower cost, and are changing how we use computers.</p>  <p style="text-indent: 0.25in">Microsoft released Windows 95 on August 24, 1995. That marked the beginning of a world dominated by Windows. Everyone knew of Microsoft and its CEO Bill Gates. There was however, another company that had lived in Microsoft’s shadow and its CEO was about to step into the light. Oracle had become a publicly owned company just one day before Microsoft and yet no one knew of it, or its CEO, Larry Ellison. When Larry Ellison met with his lieutenant Farzad Dibachi, the two of them came up with an idea that they hoped would propel Oracle to the front of everyone’s minds, and take Microsoft down a notch or two.</p>  <p style="text-indent: 0.25in">Bill Gates was the main lecturer and Larry Ellison was just a warm-up speaker at the International Data Corp.’s European IT Forum in Paris. Larry Ellison then decided to unleash his idea of the Network Computer in order to bring Oracle to the front of everyone’s minds. Larry Ellison dove right into it with “A PC is a ridiculous device.” (Roth) Larry Ellison then went on to talk about the many flaws of PCs and how his Network Computer would solve these problems. Despite the backing of Sun Microsystems and many other companies, as well as a public crazy for the idea, the Network Computer was a flop. Ellison’s Network Computer only sold around 20,000 units by 1999. (Roth) Although it seemed down for the count, the idea of the Network Computer did not die.</p>  <p style="text-indent: 0.25in">Fast forward just under a decade and the computer world has changed a lot. A relative new comer named Google has become a giant in world of web searching. (Reid) The CEO of this company is Eric Schmidt. He was formerly the CTO of Sun Microsystems, one of Oracle’s backers, as well as a personal believer in Oracle’s Network Computer. (Roth) Google unleashed its newest product, Chrome OS, on July 7, 2009. Google’s Chrome OS is Google’s Chrome Browser built right on top of a compact Linux kernel. In its short life of 9 months, the browser has gathered over 30 million users. (Pichai) Google believes that,</p>  <blockquote>   <p>People want to get to their email instantly, without wasting time waiting for their computers to boot and browsers to start up. They want their computers to always run as fast as when they first bought them. They want their data to be accessible to them wherever they are and not have to worry about losing their computer or forgetting to back up files. Even more importantly, they don&rsquo;t want to spend hours configuring their computers to work with every new piece of hardware, or have to worry about constant software updates. (Pichai)</p> </blockquote>  <p>Google also feels that their Chrome OS will do these things.</p>  <p style="text-indent: 0.25in">Oracle’s Network Computer was to have no local storage, and no hard drive. Everything would be stored on a server somewhere, and accessed over the network on this Network Computer. When it comes out, Google’s Chrome OS will have some local storage, but that local storage will mostly be storing data while you are working on it. It will not save the file for long-term use. The idea is that by storing data on a server instead of the machine the user does not have to backup their data, nor worry about anti-malware since everything is on the server and the server owner will worry about backing up as well as protection form malware. (Bournellis; Tweney) This is not the first major departure from the norm for the Network Computer and Chrome OS.</p>  <p style="text-indent: 0.25in">Google not only wants to change where you store data but where you run your applications. Google’s Chrome OS will only run web applications. This is in contrast to a normal computer running Windows or OS X where you can run web applications as well as applications running completely on the system. (Pichai) Oracle’s Network Computer was also to use Web Applications. The web applications Network Computer used Sun Microsystems’ Java Language. Using web applications would mean that the user does not have to install programs in order to use them, but rather they can just use them. </p>  <p style="text-indent: 0.25in">Oracle’s Network Computer was only to cost around $500. One can compare this price to the $1,500 price for a Desktop Computer. The Network Computer achieves this in a couple of ways. First, since all data is stored on a server, the Network Computer can throw out the hard drive. The Network Computer also required less powerful processors and less memory since web applications where usually less complex then their desktop counterparts. These helped make the Network Computer cheaper for the standard user. The Network Computer was to save businesses more money as well. Web applications only need to be installed on each sever for all uses to use, which makes deploying them cheaper. (“The future is now”) The Network Computer would be cheaper for businesses as well as consumers.</p>  <p style="text-indent: 0.25in">Google plans to make Chrome OS cheaper than a normal Desktop Computer. One way Google will make this happen will be through making the Chrome OS need a less powerful hardware and no hard drive, like the Network Computer. Google also plans to charge nothing for Chrome OS. This is in contrast to Windows based computers which Microsoft charges manufactures fifty dollars or more to use; which can be 10% or more of the cost of netbooks, which is the market Google plans to have Chrome OS on. (Sorrel) Google’s Chrome OS has yet to fail, though it may in time.</p>  <p style="text-indent: 0.25in">Oracle’s Network Computer did change the computer world even though it failed at becoming something that everyone would own. To fight back Desktop Computer makers took to making their machines cheaper and cheaper, hitting one of the selling points used by Network Computer. (Roth) The Network Computer also put Microsoft on the defense. Fearing that it would become a casualty of the Internet, Microsoft became obsessed with the internet related products. Microsoft fought a battle with Netscape over whose browsers consumers and business would use. This battle made browsers free in the end, instead of the fifty dollars or more that Netscape wanted to charge. (Johnson; Roth) Finally, the Network computer did succeed in one goal set by Larry Ellison. The Network Computer brought Oracle to the top, making Oracle as well know as Microsoft. (Roth) Oracle’s Network Computer failed for the most part, but Google’s Chrome OS has not even shipped yet.</p>  <p style="text-indent: 0.25in">Despite the fact that Google’s Chrome OS has yet to ship it is making waves in the computing world already. Microsoft has announced that it will release a web-based version of Microsoft Office 2010 to compete with Google Docs. (Spring) Apple and Google have been allies in the past against Microsoft. Now though they are competitors. This has prompted the CEO of Google to leave Apple’s Board. (Oreskovic) Google’s Chrome has not much time to make changes, so for now users will have to wait and see what changes will come about.</p>  <p style="text-indent: 0.25in">Despite the many similarities between Google’s Chrome OS and Oracle’s Network Computer, they do have some differences. Google has said that they are positioning Chrome OS to be something you use when you just need to do some basic quick stuff, not to replace Windows. They believe that normal Windows computers have a place doing tasks like running Photoshop that require more power. Oracle on the other hand clearly wanted to replace Windows and maybe even Microsoft it’s self with the Network Computer. Local networks like a company’s intranet were what Oracle had in mind for the Network Computer, with some Internet stuff. Google though has designed Chrome OS for the Internet, though it could in theory work for local networks too. (Stokes; Roth)</p>  <p style="text-indent: 0.25in">Both Oracle’s Network Computer and Google’s Chrome OS have made changes in the world of computing, the most visible to consumers being the lower price of computers. They both promote a server base storage system as well as Web-Apps. The Network Computer failed as far as its goal of changing of we use computers to a method of web or network only use. Chrome OS starts where the Network Computer stopped, but only time will tell if it will also share its fate.</p>  <p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p>  <p>Bournellis, Cynthia. &ldquo;Network computers&ndash;hype and hope.&rdquo; <em>Electronic News (10616624)</em> 44.2215 (1998): 1. <em>Academic Search Premier</em>.
