<p>My first home server was back in 2009 using the first version of Windows Home Server. When WHS 2011 came out I got a new server (pretty much the current configuration from <a href="http://bgtechrants.blogspot.com/2012/09/my-home-network-upgrade-part-1-current.html" target="_blank">part 1</a>) to run it and upgraded with no question of installing another OS. This time though I find myself in a pickle about what OS to install.</p> <ul><li>Option 1 is to keep 2011. I know it, getting 90% of what I want will be quick and easy. Down side is not getting to use both of my physical processors, and being slightly locked into how it gets stuff done.</li> <li>Option 2 is to install 2012 Essentials. From what I can tell (from <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/article/windows-server/windows-server-2012-essentials-home-server-replacement-144275" target="_blank">Paul Thurrott’s post</a>) for the most part it will just work like an in place upgrade of 2011 (WHS2012?). Downsides are I have to wait longer to upgrade since its not out yet and that it will inherit some of the downside&rsquo;s of WHS (though I can’t be sure of that yet. One huge advantage though is that it can do an in place install to 2012 Standard, which leads us to…</li> <li>Option 3 which is to just install 2012 Standard. Advantages are complete control on how things are done and very little in the way of limitations. Downsides is that I have to do everything myself (though not knowing I’d have option 2 I’ve been looking into how to and seem to have an idea at least about how to).</li></ul><p>Right now I’m leaning towards installing 2012 Essentials (options 2) and if I need to upgrading to 2012 Standard (option 3).</p>
