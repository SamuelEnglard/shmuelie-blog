<p>By the end of this year I plan to upgrade my home network to be all Windows 8 on the clients and to upgrade the server to 2012, along with some hardware and software upgrades to the server. Since someone out there might want to do some of the crazy stuff I am I figured I document this (I admit slow) process.</p> <p>Currently the network consists of two desktops and two laptops running Windows 7 SP1 and a server running Windows Home Server 2011. All this is connected by a dual band Wireless-N router with 1000Base-T.</p> <p>The servers currently has two AMD Opteron 246 HEs (single core, 2GHz), 8 GB of 200MHz RAM, 3 internal PATA Hard Drives (250GB, 120GB, and 80GB), one USB 3.0 3TB Drive, and a PCI USB 3.0 card. Its not a bad server and for the most part I’m OK with it. To upgrade the server I got two AMD Opteron 885s (dual core, 2.6GHz), two 3TB SATA Hard Drives, 3 Single Tuner PCI cards, 3 IR controllers, and required cables.</p> <p>(For those wondering why I got the 3 IR controllers: my cable provider is Comcast who now sends digital signals that are encrypted and my 3 tuners are analog only. My plan is to have each tuner behind a converter box which the server can control using IR.)</p> <p>Originally I had planned to not upgrade the server to 2012 because Windows Home Server 2011 did so much for me. Yes everything it does can be recreated but why spend the time if I don’t need to. Sadly I found a flaw with Windows Home Server 2011 that I couldn’t ignore. It will only use one physical processor. It can be a 200 core processor and you’d be OK but if you have more than one physical processor it will just use one. This I couldn’t live with so I had to switch to a normal Windows Server version and if I had to I might as well use 2012.</p> <p>In my next post I’ll explain my software plans, including how to replace Windows Homer Server 2011 abilities.</p>
