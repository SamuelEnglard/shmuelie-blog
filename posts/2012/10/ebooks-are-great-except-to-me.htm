<p>eBooks are the the greatest thing since sliced break some people say. And at times I find myself agreeing with them. There&rsquo;s something to be said for not lugging around heavy books in addition to a laptop/tablet/phone. I’ve done it for text books and loved. But generally I don’t like them for one simple reason: I’m Jewish.</p> <p>Now being Jewish doesn’t meant I must hate technology or something like that but it does make for an interesting problem. You see Sabbath observing Jews have a set of rules of things the can and cannot do on the Sabbath, one of which is NO ELECTRONICS. Yup, no computer, phone, tablet, or TV. So what to do? Well usually I read, but if my books are all in eBook form I can’t. So while I think eBooks are a great idea, I personally fine them less than optimal. </p>
