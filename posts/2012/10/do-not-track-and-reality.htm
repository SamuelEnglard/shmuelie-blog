<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/us/ed.bott/" target="_blank">Ed Bott</a> has a great <a title="Ad industry blasts Microsoft over Do Not Track defaults in IE 10" href="http://www.zdnet.com/ad-industry-blasts-microsoft-over-do-not-track-defaults-in-ie-10-7000005185/" target="_blank">article</a> Board of Directors of the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) complaining publicly about Microsoft&rsquo;s decision to turn Do Not Track (DNT) on by default in Internet Explore 10. In the article Bott does a great job taking about every argument that the ANA gives about why they are right and Microsoft is wrong.</p> <p>Now previously I worked at an ad serving company as the second to top software engineer on the ad servers, so I happen to know a bit about the ad industry including the tracking. After reading Bott’s article, the <a title="ANA Board Opposes Microsoft’s Decision to Implement ‘Do-Not-Track’ Default Function for Internet Explorer 10 Browser" href="http://www.ana.net/content/show/id/analetter-microsoft#_ftn1" target="_blank">ANA’s original post</a>, the <a title="Tracking Preference Expression (DNT)" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/" target="_blank">W3C’s Working Draft on DNT</a>, and the <a title="Tracking Compliance and Scope" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-compliance/" target="_blank">W3C’s complimentary document that explains the practical usage of DNT for web companies</a> (honestly the <a title="Do Not Track: A Universal Third-Party Web Tracking Opt Out" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mayer-do-not-track-00" target="_blank">IETF’s version</a> was much simpler) I plan to refute the AN’s arguments in the section titled “Microsoft’s Unilateral Action Risks Undercutting the Existing Broad Array of Internet Content and Services”.</p> <p>(And before anyone gives the “your knowledge is only good in country X”, while I am based in the US they serve ads all over the world (North and South America, Asia, Europe, and Asia Minor).)</p> <p>The W3C’s Tracking Compliance and Scope Draft has a lovely section called “<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-compliance/#permitted-uses" target="_blank">Permitted Operational Uses for Third Parties and Service Providers</a>” which states:</p> <blockquote> <p>If a third-party receives a communication to which a DNT:1 header is attached, that third party <em>MAY</em> nevertheless collect, use, and retain information related to that communication for these permitted uses: </p><ul><li>Short term collection and use, where information is not transmitted to a third party or used to profile or personalize a user&rsquo;s experience;  </li><li>Contextual content or ad delivery;  </li><li>Content or Ad Delivery Based on First Party Data  </li><li>Frequency Capping  </li><li>Financial Logging and Auditing  </li><li>Security and Fraud Prevention  </li><li>Aggregate Reporting  </li><li>Debugging  </li><li>Compliance With Local Laws and Public Purposes</li></ul>As long as there is:  <ul><li>No Secondary Use  </li><li>Data Minimization and Transparency  </li><li>Reasonable Security  </li><li>No Personalization</li></ul></blockquote> <p>And what do you know the ANA complains that DNT blocks them from doing “fraud detection in financial services to prevention of online threats” and “relevant via tailored content”. Well in that list above Fraud Protection is clearly allowed. And using either the current page’s context or information that the website they are on gave the advertiser ads can be tailored to the user!</p> <p>My favorite line those is this one: </p> <blockquote> <p>“web viewing data … and is used to support the offering of online products and services at low or no cost”</p></blockquote> <p>Note they did not say that ads are used to make online products or services free but the data they collect from you. Now ignoring some of the more obvious problems with this (like does that mean the ads are pointless?) I can state that this is false. Remember that ad company I worked for and helped with their ad servers? Well their ad servers ONLY did tracking to allow for frequency capping. Besides that being on the list that the W3C allows (meaning that even with DNT turned on nothing would change), that means that in a worst case scenario where we had to turn that off we would not only be able to still serve ads but make money. And if we were making money so are the website owners, so unless I am crazy that does not “drastically damage the online experience by reducing the Internet content and offerings that such advertising supports” as the ANA believes. (Also here is a little hint, at times they have operated like DNT was on for technical reasons and they are still in business so…)</p>
