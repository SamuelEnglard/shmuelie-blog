<p>An interesting thing to note is that as I said a <a href="http://bgtechrants.blogspot.com/2012/10/do-not-track-and-reality.html" target="_blank">previous post</a> about DNT (though not clearly I admit) is that the ad company I worked for did contextual ads, not personalized. Why though, after all I said <a href="http://bgtechrants.blogspot.com/2012/10/do-not-track-in-english.html" target="_blank">previously</a> that holy grail of advertising. Well here’s the thing, it’s the holy grail in a pure “Web 2.0” web. What I mean by that is that for Google and Microsoft, who are mostly serving ads via search (and blogs for Google), they have no idea what will end up on the page so trying the contextual method would fail. The personalize method though would work and that’s why they want it. The company I worked for though worked with big name customers only; Times, RandomHouse, Fox News, and CBS Interactive (who owns ZDNet interestingly enough) for example. This meant that we worked with them directly to get ads done so we knew exactly the context ads could be going and therefore could use the contextual method.</p>
