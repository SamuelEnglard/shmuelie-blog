<p>1) Despite Verizon not be very enthusiastic about Windows Phone, I got a Trophy and have loved it. I love it so much that when I went to Israel on vacation I used it as my phone abroad too! </p><p>2) I have been listening to the Windows Developer Show since its beginning when it was called the Windows Phone Developer Show. I even called in once and got the show named after me!

(Not surprisingly it was rejected for copyright infringement) </p><p>4) I listened to the Windows Phone Radio podcast with Brian Seitz and Matt Akers and miss it tons! </p><p>5) I sold someone on getting a Windows Phone because of its great Office integration (<a href="https://twitter.com/Shmuelie/status/256431437811695616" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/Shmuelie/status/256431437811695616</a>) </p><p>6) I went to the Nokia Event in NYC for the announcement of the 920. </p><p>7) I have a “Love me and my Windows Phone App” T-shirt as well as a Nokia 900 T-shirt. </p><p>8) To keep my unlimited data on Verizon I plan to buy my Windows Phone 8 Phone outright.</p>
