<p>In <a href="http://bgtechrants.blogspot.com/2012/09/my-home-network-update-part-2-server-os.html" target="_blank">part 2</a> I debated about which version Windows Server to put on my home server; Windows Home Server 2011, Windows Server 2012 Essentials, or Windows Server 2012 Standard. Based on articles by Paul Thurrott including his <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/article/windows-server/windows-server-2012-essentials-access-server-remotely-144435" target="_blank">most recent</a> I’ve decided that I’ll use Essentials since a lot of what I want my server to do (which I’ll be covering in part 3) it will do with little to no work from me.</p>
