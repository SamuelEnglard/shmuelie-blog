<p>After reading <a href="https://twitter.com/getwired" target="_blank">Wes Miller’s</a> article on why <a title="Why Do Not Track is destined to fail (DNT is DOA)" href="http://getwired.com/2012/03/13/why-do-not-track-is-destined-to-fail-dnt-is-doa/" target="_blank">Do Not Track (DNT) will fail</a>, I had a crazy idea. One big problem with DNT that Miller lists is</p> <blockquote> <p>most consumers have no idea what DNT is. No kidding. I’ve worked in/around the Internet and security for years, and <em>I</em> can’t define it – at least not as the name stands today.</p></blockquote> <p>At the core Miller is right. DNT’s name is based more on public fears than reality though, in some regard it does stay true to its aim. Even more important than if the name is correct or not though is what it does (or at least will do). So after messing around with the W3C’s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/" target="_blank">Tracking Preference Expression</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-compliance/" target="_blank">Tracking Compliance and Scope</a> Drafts for my <a title="Do Not Track and Reality" href="http://bgtechrants.blogspot.com/2012/10/do-not-track-and-reality.html" target="_blank">last post</a> I’m going to TRY and explain DNT in simple English. First some background knowledge some topics that will make understanding DNT much easier. Than I’ll actually explain DNT it’s self from a consumer prospective (so no API, HTTP, or JavaScript talk).</p> <p>In general there are 3 types of ads: Random, Contextual, and Personalized. </p> <ul><li>Random is simply the ad network randomly selects an ad and displays it to you. Its cheap and will work anywhere. Downside is that more likely than not the audience will not care about the ad (and there for won’t click which is where the real money is generally). Because of the problems with it it’s a rarely used solution. Usually it’s used in cases where they have nothing in the other two type of ads to show you. (Personally I think this explains all those Viagra commercials on children’s TV.) <br /></li><li>Contextual is where the ad is show to you based on what the website you’re on is about.Websites can even sub divided further into contexts that are based on the whole site (like seeing an add for a CBS TV show on CBS.com) or ones that are based on the actual content of the page (ads for a cell phone an article about cell phones). The idea is that you are interesting in X because this site or page has X so show you an ad about X. This method has a couple of problems. The first problem is that in some cases site “level” context is useless, like on a news website, where there are so many different interests that trying to target them all and them display any of them is effectively the random method. The second problem is unless the ad network is working one-on-one with the website (I’ve done that) the ad network has no way to know the context of every page, forcing them to fall back to site context. Finally in some cases the “web page is about X so you like X” correlation itself can fail, either in that there is no clear X to show ads about or just because one time you’re reading about X does not mean you want to buy X (Just because I read an article about Mattel made a Geek Barbie does NOT mean I want to buy one). <br /></li><li>Personalized ads are where the ad network knows where you’ve been (for instance Newegg) and therefore shows you ads for them on other sites. The ads are (in theory at least) highly likely to be interesting to you since they are tailored to you. It’s the holy grail of advertising. Down sides? The need for data about where you’ve been. Getting it and you not complaining about it are not easy. Currently Google is one of the biggest and most well known in this space.</li></ul><p>In theory (a.k.a a perfect world) personalized ads would be what we’d all want and have. It fits in perfectly with a world where the idea of filtering news,music, and more to only what we care about is common. Problem is, we don’t live in a perfect world. </p> <p>First we have the fact that whether it’s just paranoia or not we as a general rule don’t trust companies with our information after a while. The other problem is that the personalization methods aren’t perfect so at time they can get…weird results (for instance, why do I as a Jewish Orthodox male want to have a date with a male Christian….). As such some people don’t like the whole personalization idea. Problem is ad agencies do.</p> <p>Now after all that introduction I get to explain to you what DNT is. DNT is an attempt to compromise on the two sides of personalization. A web device can send a message to a web server with each request stating that the user does not want to be “tracked”. “Tracked” means that the website (or an ad network that the website has added, which I’ll just call the website from now on) cannot note that a user visited the site for the purpose of knowing what the user is interested in. The website can note that a visitor visited the site for other reasons, like keeping users logged in, protecting them from fraud, and more. BUT if they do they cannot use that data to personalize ads. It’s that simple.</p>
