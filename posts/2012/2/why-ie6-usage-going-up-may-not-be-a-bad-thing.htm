<p>As has been blogged about <a href="http://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=3&amp;qpcustomb=0" target="_blank">IE6 usage has risen between December 2011 and January 2012</a>. Now Iâ€™m not here to say that this is wrong, but instead to say how it may not be a bad thing. Now we can see that <a href="http://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=11&amp;qpcustomb=0" target="_blank">Windows XP usage went up</a> in this time frame. Now while people can obviously still install Windows XP on computers, very few people are, and its even harder to buy an new computer with XP. We also know that a good portion of IE6 and XP usage comes from intranet sites built against IE6.</p>  <p>My theory is that what is really happening is that as companies upgrade to Windows 7 they are installing some kind of virtualization software and running IE6 on XP that way for their intranet!</p>  <p>Thoughts?</p>
