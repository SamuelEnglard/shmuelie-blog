<p>So as I said <a href="http://bgtechrants.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-quest-for-right-office365-plan.html" target="_blank">previously</a> I wanted to move to Office 365 and I did so on Monday. One of the big reasons I wanted it was so I could have complex sorting rules. One of the reason I want/have these complex rules is that I like to sort emails from Twitter and Facebook in to people’s personal folders. I  thought I’d share the rules I built.</p> <p>For twitter you want to check if the email address contains “@twitter.com” and if the subject contains (replace my Twitter name and handle with the user’s) “Shmueli Englard (@shmuelie) favorited one of your Tweets!” or “Shmueli Englard (@shmuelie) mentioned you on Twitter!” or “Shmueli Englard (@shmuelie) replied to one of your Tweets!” or “Shmueli Englard (@shmuelie) has sent you a direct message on Twitter!” or “Shmueli Englard (@shmuelie) retweeted one of your Tweets!”.</p> <p>For Facebook you want to check if the email address contains “@facebookmail.com” and if the subject contains the users display name. You also need to set it to not work though if “commented on NAME’s” is in the subject (so that people comment on their stuff won’t go to their folder).</p>
