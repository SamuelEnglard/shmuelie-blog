<p>Since in <a href="http://bgtechrants.blogspot.com/2012/10/my-home-network-update-part-25-sever-os.html" target="_blank">part 2.5</a> I decided that I’ll be upgrading the Server’s OS to Windows Server 2012 Essentials, now I’ll say what my grand plan is for this server. Something I plan to have it doing are “done automatically” by getting Essentials others I will have to do myself. </p> <ul><li>File Sharing (Essentials) <br />Sounds simple but having file shares can save tons of hard disk space, though most if not all of the files I want to put on the share are media. The other advantage is that I can use de-duplication to save even more space (which works very well with music collections and the like which don’t change that often).  </li><li>Centralized Client Backup (Essentials) <br />In theory I could just have each machine backup to a network share but then I would have to worry about making sure they don’t try to backup at the same time and dealing with the fact that each machine will (most likely) have tons of files that could be de-duplicated to save space.  </li><li>Remote Restoration of Client Machines (Essentials) <br />The ability to restore machines over the network with minimal work was something I fell in love with from Windows Home Server 2011 and want to keep. It’s much better than the alternative of loading the system image on to an external hard disk and moving it.  </li><li>VPN (Essentials) <br />While the ability to access files from a website is nice, the ability to just use the server like I’m at home when I’m not would be great! It will also allow devices like my iPad to access resources on the go (Since the website doesn’t really work all that well for some tasks). It will also allow me to backup machines that aren’t at “home” (though I’ll want to make sure not to much needs to be sent before I do this).  </li><li>Remote Desktop Gateway (Essentials or Me) <br />For devices that are unable to connect to a VPN or I can’t connect to one I can use a Remote Desktop Gateway to remote into machines on the network. I believe that Essentials can do this but if like on Windows Home Server 2011 and it&rsquo;s a custom implementation instead of the standard one I’ll have to do it myself.  </li><li>Remote File Access (Essentials) <br />While yes via a VPN or RPD I could access my files having a website to access them would be very nice, even more so if it can open some files on the web (Media in either Silverlight/Flash or HTML5 and Office documents in Office Online for example).  </li><li>Media Server (Essentials and Me) <br />This is a bit of a complex one. Essentials should provide basic DNLA based streaming but I need it to be able to stream live TV as well, which will be me. How this will be done I will explain in a future post.  </li><li>DVR (Me) <br />The primary reason I need it to be able to stream TV live is so that I can also make it a DVR. The reason for this is that I have Comcast and they encrypt their stream. What this means is that I need to have any tuner, even a digital one, behind one of their cable boxes which of course they’ll charge me for. To save money I plan to have all my cable boxes go to the server and then from the server to TVs from the media server part.  </li><li>Media Encoder (Me) <br />I am constantly getting new music, TV shows, music videos, and movies added to my collection. Taking the time to convert them all to one format, enter the correct data, and put them in the correct folder can take a while. I’d like to streamline this process.</li></ul>
