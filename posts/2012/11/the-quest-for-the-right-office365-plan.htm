<p>Some time in 2004 I got a Hotmail email account and have loved, for the most part. Over the years Microsoft has fixed most of my problems. Office 2013 fixed the lack of a good way to work with Outlook problem, leaving only two problems to fix. </p> <p>My first is that for reasons unknown Microsoft only allows 127 user created folders (7 bit IDs maybe?) and I have tons more than that. For now my solution has been to keep all but the 127 most important emails in an offline PST file. I’ve not liked doing this but was willing to live with it. Ironically in fix the Outlook/Hotmail problem by giving Outlook 2013 the ability to use ActiveSync to access emails Microsoft also gave me a new problem; No way to move emails up to my Hotmail account. My second problem is that while Hotmail does have sorting rules compare to what Outlook provides they are just plain sad. When you have as many folders as I do, sorting rules start to become a necessity, not just a nice-to-have.</p> <p>Now some people have suggested I use Google’s Gmail. Main problem in the past was that it had worse Outlook integration than Hotmail and that well, it’s Google. In using ActiveSync, Microsoft has solved the integration problem for Gmail but the “It’s Google” part has gotten worse. Over time Google has gone from being on my “I’ll use it if there’s nothing else free” to my “I’ll use it only on penalty of death” list. So Gmail is not an option.</p> <p>So I’ve decided to give Office 365 a try. Only one problem, while I know I can get what I want with it, what plan do I need to get? While I could get their E3 plan and clearly have what I need, I really don’t want to be paying $22 a month for my email. The $4 “Email” plan is much easier to swallow price wise, but unless I’m mistaken I’d lose SkyDrive which I’ve started to become attached to (even more so with my Surface and Windows Phone).</p> <p>So now I find myself on the hunt for the right Office 365 plan. May the email gods help me!</p>
