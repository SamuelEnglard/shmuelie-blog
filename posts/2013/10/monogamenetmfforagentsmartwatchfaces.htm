        <p>Over the summer I started a library that is API based on MonoGame (that is the function and the like look very similar to the MonoGame ones but will usually have differences) for the .NET Micro Framework.</p>
        <p>The reason for this is that I had just pre-ordered a AGENT Smartwatch and being a MonoGame Evangelist I thought it would be cool to try and port MonoGame to the watch. Obviously that did not work, primarily because of limitation in the Micro Framework compare to the &ldquo;non-Micro&rdquo; Framework.</p>
        <p>As I started to mess around with the &ldquo;MonoGame&rdquo; and the watch&rsquo;s SDK I realized that that it could be used for more than just creating watch games (or companion games to games on other Bluetooth enabled devices). At its core what MonoGame gives you is a way to redraw the screen (or a Window on desktops) in a very fast loop. This sounds very much like what you want to create a watch face for AGENT. You loop to update the time as well as animations you probably have.</p>
        <p>So why not use it? Well it does over complicate it if you are just creating a simple watch face that shows say the time in two or three time zones at ones. And I suppose if you hate XNA and/or MonoGame I wouldn&rsquo;t use this either, but how you could hate them I don&rsquo;t know!</p>
        <p>I personally plan to convert my watch faces to use MonoGame .NETMF and use it for all future ones too.</p>
