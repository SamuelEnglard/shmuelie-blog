        <p>For those who follow my blog you&rsquo;ll have noted that I haven&rsquo;t blogged for just over 3 months! I admit that&rsquo;s a long time.</p>
        <p>The primary reason for this was I was working crazy hours at work. The good news is that I have been laid off so now I&rsquo;ll have the free time to post. Of course the bad news is that I&rsquo;m looking for a new job (wink-wink-nudge-nudge)</p>
