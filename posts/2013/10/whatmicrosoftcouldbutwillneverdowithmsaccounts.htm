        <p>We all remember carrying around floppies, then CDs, and then flash drives so that when we went to use a library or friend&rsquo;s computer or simply another computer we owned we would have our files. Problem was that even if we had our files we had to hope that the computer had a program that could open them. Common file types like JPG and DOC were pretty safe with but a program to open a PSD, much less likely.</p>
        <p>Then we got things like Folder Share which allowed us to keep files in sync between our own computers. After that came SkyDrive and DropBox allowing use to not only sync the files but also access them from a web portal so we could get at them from computers that were not our own.</p>
        <p>Now we come to today were both iOS and Windows 8 do not just sync files and have web access but saves your settings and what apps you have installed so getting a new machine or reinstalling the OS (or a factory reset) is way less painful then it use to be. But there are sadly some steps that we will like never truly see.</p>
        <p>Imagine going to a friends computer and just logging in with your account. immediately a set of default apps you like to have are downloaded, the machine is configured with the settings you like and your files are pulled down from the cloud (or linked like SkyDrive in Windows 8.1 does). In essence you have just transformed your friends machine into your own by just logging in. Not only that but when you&rsquo;re done besides signing out you can also remove your profile from the machine, completely undoing everything we just listed. This leaves the machine is the exact same state as when you came over.</p>
        <p>Now I admit this sounds very much like what you can already do today but there is a subtle difference. The current system we have is designed for case where you replace a machine or make it like new, NOT for brand new machines. If I get a second laptop I do not want it to be exactly the same as my first one. What I would want is a common &ldquo;personal install&rdquo; for that machine when I log in.</p>
        <p>What I am suggest is Microsoft could take a concept that we already have, the Default Profile, and extend it to the cloud. For those who do not know the Default Profile is a user profile that is used as a template for new user accounts. Those default icons in your start menu or on your desktop come from there. But what if Microsoft create a similar concept but was something you edited from a web page that allowed you to set default settings that you wanted every new computer you log into to have? Obviously during install you could also choose to use and existing computer as you can now.</p>
        <p>Sadly Microsoft will not do this. Why? They will not because now a days very few people go and use library computers or a friends. This is because they all have tablets or ultrabooks of some kind making it easier to just use their own machine. Do I still want this ability? YES. Will I get it though? I suspect not.</p>
