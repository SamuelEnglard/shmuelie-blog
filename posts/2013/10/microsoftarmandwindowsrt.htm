        <p>Originally I was going to have a post replying to <a href="http://ww.twitter.com/getwired" target="_blank">Wes Miller&rsquo;s</a> &ldquo;<a href="http://getwired.com/2013/10/30/windows-server-on-arm-processors-i-dont-think-so/" target="_blank">Windows Server on ARM processors? I don’t think so</a>&rdquo; and one replying to <a href="http://ww.twitter.com/thurrott" target="_blank">Paul Thurrott&rsquo;s</a> &ldquo;<a href="http://winsupersite.com/mobile-devices/assessing-chromebook-threat" target="_blank">Assessing the Chromebook Threat</a>&rdquo;. As I thought more about my replies I realized that the two we&rsquo;re not only going to have some crossover but in some cases require something from the other. Therefore I have combined the two into one.</p>
        <p>As a quick overview of the two posts Miller argues against a Windows Server RT appearing and Thurrott shows how Chromebooks don&rsquo;t threaten Microsoft too much, currently.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking I agree with Miller that a Windows Server RT just will not happen because what ARM brings to the platform just isn&rsquo;t really need in the end (see Itanium). Technically speaking both server and client are using the same core and that has been ported to ARM, though that is not to say there is nothing more to do. I think though that Microsoft might want to &ldquo;finish the job&rdquo; for one reason. Not to make Windows Server RT but to help make the code more portable for the future. After all that is one of the strengths of the NT core, and the reason that not only is still used after all these years but is now used for Windows Phone too. Expanding on that ability (to a point of course) I think would be a good idea.</p>
        <p>As to Thurrot&rsquo;s dismissal of Chromebook I see his point but then I think about my friends working in BestBuy and what they tell me. While they don&rsquo;t say the Chromebooks are a extreme hit they are moving and not a lot of returns. So I have to think about what people are doing on their computers. I&rsquo;ll use my mom as the cliche example. She checks her email,checks Facebook, plays Facebook games, and uses Facebook chat (from Facebook.com). Would a Chromebook work for her? Sure! everything she is doing is web-based (she currently uses Outlook 2013 to check email but that could easily enough be changed to Outlook.com). Another thing we need to factor is that while Google is not Apple and doesn&rsquo;t have their scary good Reality Distortion Field™ they seem to still be able to hide behind &ldquo;Do no Evil&rdquo; and get the love of the public (though recent Google actions are starting to hurt that). Even more people love using Chrome to browse with, &ldquo;Its fast&rdquo;, &ldquo;I can develop right in it&rdquo;, &ldquo;it integrates with all my Google stuff so well&rdquo;, and more. So I disagree with Thurrott in the long term. Right now they may not be much of a threat but give them enough time and Google make them a threat.</p>
        <p>So far I&rsquo;ve just replied to each article on its own but here&rsquo;s the connection. While here I talked about Miller&rsquo;s post first and Thurrott&rsquo;s second I read the originally the other way around. As such Miller&rsquo;s I think just happens to give a solution to the Chromebook threat. Not only that but it the solution is something Microsoft already has but just is not using in this way.</p>
        <p>That solution is &ldquo;Kiosk Mode&rdquo; that comes with Windows 8.1, which for those of you who don&rsquo;t know is a mode that locks an account to be able to only run a selected Metro/Modern app. Obviously this is meant for places like an airport to allow flyers to self check-in. But as the Geek.com notes in &ldquo;<a href="http://www.geek.com/microsoft/windows-8-1-kiosk-mode-locks-systems-to-a-single-app-1552963/" target="_blank">Windows 8.1 kiosk mode locks systems to a single app</a>&rdquo; this could easily make an ExplorerBook(?) by making the single app Metro/Modern Internet Explorer. But what I want to add is that Kiosk Mode is available on Windows RT. Let that sink in for a minute. Windows RT runs on ARM, so (in theory) it can be on cheaper hardware. And as Thurrott notes in &ldquo;<a href="http://winsupersite.com/mobile-devices/surface-2-review" target="_blank">Surface 2 Review</a>&rdquo;, on the right hardware Windows RT can be pretty snappy.</p>
        <p>Now lets check those advantages of a Chromebook again:</p>
        <ul><li>Cheaper. Windows RT running ARM can be too.</li>
        <li>Web Only so much simpler. Locked into Internet Explore.</li>
        <li>Runs the &ldquo;Fast&rdquo; Chrome. IE 11 is pretty darn fast now.</li>
        <li>Integrates well with Google ecosystem. Can&rsquo;t directly with that but IE isn&rsquo;t made for the open web so you can use ANY ecosystem.</li>
        </ul><p>So about those advantages&hellip;</p>
