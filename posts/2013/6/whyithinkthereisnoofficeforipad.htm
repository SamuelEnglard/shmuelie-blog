        <p>Last week Microsoft finally released Mobile Office for iPhone and yet everyone seems to be confused about why no Office for iPad too.</p>
        <p>The Office Microsoft released on iPhone is (for the most part) just a port of the Mobile Office Windows Phone users have had for years now. Only real changes where to make it fit into iOS design better and to deal with iOS limitations.</p>
        <p>With this in mind the idea of a iPad Office not being released yet makes sense both business wise (and depending on what rumors are true code as well). From a business perspective Microsoft firsts gives their platform a year or two and then release for the competition. Surface (and the iPad style generation of Windows Tablets) have not been out even a year yet.</p>
        <p>On the code side one must remember that the Office we get on Windows Tablets is really just the Desktop version. We know Microsoft is working on &ldquo;Metro&rdquo; versions of Office. If they have not built Office for iPad yet then they could be wait to do a port of the &ldquo;Metro&rdquo; version to iPad similar to what they did for iPhone from Windows Phone.</p>
