<p>About 3 months ago I made a <a href="http://Steve%20Marx%20(@smarx)%20mentioned%20you%20on%20Twitter!" target="_blank">post</a> about how I was going to show how to create upgrade applications using Windows Azure and WebAPI. I had started working on part two and then sadly had found bugs in what I had. Luckily they have all been finally worked out and I should soon have Part 2 and more up!</p>
