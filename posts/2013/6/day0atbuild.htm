        <p>While Build officially starts tomorrow (or today depending on how you look at it) There was plenty of stuff to do today (25th).</p>
        <p>First there was the Xamarin Party where I got to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza" target="_blank">Miguel de Icaza</a>, tons of Xamarin staff, and <a href="https://twitter.com/KonajuGames/" target="_blank">Steve Williams</a>.</p>
        <p>Then I went to the Nokia dinner where I got to catch up with <a href="https://twitter.com/lancewmccarthy/" target="_blank">Lance McCarthy</a>Â and <a href="https://twitter.com/maryjofoley" target="_blank">Mary Jo Foley</a>. I got to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/edbott" target="_blank">Ed Bott</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ChevonChr/" target="_blank">Chevon Christie</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/IrisClasson" target="_blank">Iris Classon</a> (who was at least 10 times cooler than I thought she&rsquo;d be).</p>
        <p>After going back to the Xamarin party for a while we heard there was a second Nokia party. Not wanting to miss out on any fun we went to where the party was suppose to be. Apparently though while there was a party it was a wedding&hellip;woops!</p>
        <p>So that sums up day 0. Mostly meeting tons of people. Tomorrow the fun begins!</p>
