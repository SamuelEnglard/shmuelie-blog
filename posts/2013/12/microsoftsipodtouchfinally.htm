        <p>On Monday I decided I hadn&rsquo;t visited my local Microsoft Store recently enough. While there I saw this sign and it made my day.</p>
        <p><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/119221ce81ad441547a41953fb5591c0/tumblr_inline_mxo4vbj6w61rcmg0i.jpg" /></p>
        <p>The reason this made my day is since the days of the Zune (yes that&rsquo;s the throw back isn&rsquo;t it) Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t had a modern competitor to the iPod Touch (and Windows Mobile/CE PDA like things don&rsquo;t count, I said modern). When the Zune HD most people though it was Microsoft&rsquo;s iPod Touch. Unfortunately for Microsoft and the Zune brand it was not. It was not meant to compete at all with the Touch, instead it was to just one-up the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; iPods.</p>
        <p>Its taken Microsoft 5 years but they finally did it. And for that I applaud them.</p>
