        <p>For some reason on Friday my phone wouldn&rsquo;t sync my Office365 account, It would give me error code 80072EFD. After looking around on the internet for a while I came across a <a href="http://community.office365.com/en-us/forums/173/t/178335.aspx?PageIndex=3" target="_blank">thread on the Office365 community forums</a>. It appears to me that the last poster is right since I tried exactly what was suggested. While I had the issue (and on my Data Connection, no WiFi), I tried to go to <a href="http://ipv6.google.com" target="_blank">ipv6.google.com</a> and no luck. Turn on Airplane mode, wait for it to fully shut off all the radios, and then turn it back off. After that the account started syncing again and I could access google over IPv6 again.</p>
        <p>Don&rsquo;t know what the real issue/bug is but I hope it gets fixed before GDR3 is released.</p>
