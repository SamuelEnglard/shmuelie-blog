<p>With so many new &ldquo;Metro&rdquo; apps, Windows 8.1 making the built in &ldquo;Metro&rdquo; apps much better, and finally a Facebook app I have decided that it&rsquo;s time for an experiment. Till February first, every time I go out and don&rsquo;t want to bring my big gamming laptop I will bring my Surface RT (gen 1) with me (and Type Cover). Its time to see if Metro is there yet or not. I hope so!</p>
