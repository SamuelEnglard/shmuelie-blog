        <p>For those who don&rsquo;t know PCLs are code libraries that only reference libraries that are garenteed to be in and work the same in different implementations of .NET (and/or Mono). The idea is compile one DLL and then use it for Windows, Phone, RT, and more. For a more in depth look MSDN has a great section at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg597391.aspx" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg597391.aspx</a>.</p>
        <p>The basic idea for MonoGame is that instead of using the same code file with &ldquo;#if&rdquo; all over the place in different projects targeting different platforms code that is that code that is identical is in one PCL that all projects reference. Then each platform project only code that is different is included. Its a very interesting idea and one that I had originally thought about doing for my own MonoGame project. In the end though I didn&rsquo;t and my reasons from them still stand.</p>
        <ol><li>When projects need code that&rsquo;s completely different on top of code functions this can work more often then not its tiny little changes in the middle of functions that are 99% identical between platforms.</li>
        <li>At least for me I found with PCL I had to create more and more abstractions making code hard to follow and maintain.</li>
        <li>My last reason was that using Visual Studio and Xamarin Studio&rsquo;s ability to add a file as a link to the original location means that changes in one platform are easily propagated across platforms.</li>
        </ol><p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean I think PCL is pointless, more that for me at least it wasn&rsquo;t right and maybe the same is true of MonoGame</p>
