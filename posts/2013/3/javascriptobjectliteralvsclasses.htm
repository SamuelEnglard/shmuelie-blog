        <p>In general I use the following rules to decide if I&rsquo;m going to use an Object Literal or a Class for an Object:</p>
        <ol><li>Is the Object just going to hold data to pass around? Object Literal</li>
        <li>Is the Object used as a Singleton? Object Literal</li>
        <li>Is the Object an &ldquo;Enum&rdquo;? Object Literal</li>
        <li>Is the Object going to be created more than onceÂ AND has functions? Class</li>
        </ol><p>Those cover 99% of JavaScript classes I create, the rest are a case by case decision.</p>
