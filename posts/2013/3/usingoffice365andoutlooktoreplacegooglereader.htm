        <p>We I&rsquo;m here to offer a solution: Office365 and Outlook. While people may not know this Outlook includes a great RSS reader that I have used for years. An interesting things happens though when Outlook syncs with an Exchange server: If the RSS feeds are stored in the Exchange mailbox then they get synced to. Content and if read or not. Not only that but the feed items can be read from the web and any device that use ActiveSync to get your email from that Exchange server! No need to find if the service has an app for your device. As long as it has ActiveSync support (which most do) you can read them.</p>
        <p>Now there is one downside: The Exchange server won&rsquo;t sync the feeds, you need Outlook for that. But if you have an always on desktop just leave Outlook running&hellip;</p>
