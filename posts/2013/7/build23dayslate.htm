        <p>It maybe 23 days late but hears by round up of //BUILD/.</p>
        <p>For starters it was great to meet so many great people that I only knew on twitter before hand and now met at least in person while some I can count as people I&rsquo;d hang out with just because. I also got some books signed</p>
        <p>For the few people who will read this and don&rsquo;t know Microsoft gave all attendees:</p>
        <ol><li>A Surface Pro 128GB</li>
        <li>A Iconia W3</li>
        <li>A year of Office365 Home Premium</li>
        <li>A year of Adobe Creative Cloud</li>
        <li>A year of 100GB of SkyDrive Storage</li>
        </ol><p>Ok now while I&rsquo;d love to talk about the sessions and the new stuff Microsoft announced I feel like Mary Jo Foley, Iris Classon, and the like did a pretty good job during and right after //BUILD/ talking about that. I on the other hand spent most of my time at the show on the partner floor and I&rsquo;m going to talk about the partners from there that I find really great.</p>
        <ul><li>VSAnyWhere: A really cool collaboration tool that brings the group editing features we have in things like Google Docs to Visual Studio. It makes pair programming remotely much easier as well as some teaching scenarios. I did find the Skype integration not that useful if you have a lot of contacts like I do. Honestly a great product though and their is a free version which is just limited to public sharing and one project at a time.</li>
        <li>Buddy: They are a cross platform analytics company with honestly some of the best Tech Support I have ever gotten. One of the nicest features they have is that they expose and show in their documentation all the HTTP web calls the their SDK makes so if you want to use a platform that they don&rsquo;t support you can just make those calls your self.</li>
        <li>PreEmptive is another analytics company. They differ from Buddy in that their SDK is ejection based using attributes on your methods as well as their crash reporting is much better. Downside is their cross platform support isn&rsquo;t as good as well as they don&rsquo;t officially show the HTTP calls they make so you can do it your self (though if you were to you&rsquo;d lose some of the advantages of them).</li>
        <li>Xamarin: I&rsquo;m sure readers of my blog know I&rsquo;m a huge Xamarin fan. In a nutshell Xamarin allows you to develop in C# for iOS, Android, and MacOSX. This allows you to share code between platforms as well as simplifying the learning curve to go to a new platform.</li>
        <li>Twilio: With Mobile becoming a big thing texting is also growing and yet adding texting to our apps and services can be hard. Twilio makes it easy. They provide simple to use API for both sending and receiving text messages. And if you need extreme security why not use them for two-auth?</li>
        </ul><p>Those are the major partners I saw. Think I missed any? Let me know!</p>
