        <p>As I said <a href="http://blog.englard.net/post/39359644044/outlook-exchange-office365-rules-for-twitter-and" target="_blank">previously</a> I&rsquo;ve switched to using Office365 for my email (for reasons why see <a href="http://blog.englard.net/post/39359643549/the-quest-for-the-right-office365-plan" target="_blank">The Quest for the Right Office365 Plan</a>). So far I have been loving it! Exchange (which is what Office365 email plans use) was designed to work with Outlook well, and boy does it. Rules in Outlook sync up to the server, so rules are applied as soon as emails arrive on the server. Also nice is that the way Outlook and Exchange communicate is near instantaneous and very reliable, meaning that I don&rsquo;t have to worry about the two becoming out of sync. Finally the online access is great and very easy to use, almost app like!</p>
        <p>Of course my primary reasons for switching to Office365 was to have more folders and to have more rules to sort into those folders. And it works great! I have been creating folders like crazy to organize my emails and love it. I have a folder for every person who I interact with on Facebook or Twitter! And rules? Not only do I have a ton but as I show in a <a href="http://blog.englard.net/post/39359643549/the-quest-for-the-right-office365-plan" target="_blank">previous post</a> I can have my Twitter and Facebook emails sorted in to people&rsquo;s folders too!</p>
        <p>In short I&rsquo;m loving Office365 so far, and at only $4 a month the cost is almost nothing!</p>
