        <p>Saw an ad from Staples for Windows 8 on TV today and while the whole: You can easily switch between tablet more or laptop mode was good they had two glaring errors:</p>
        <ol><li>Ok it to show &ldquo;real&rdquo; work they showed Excel. Great! Except the version of Excel they showed was a screen shot from Excel for Mac!</li>
        <li>At the end of the ad they advertised that they are having a sale on iOS covers&hellip;.</li>
        </ol><p>Sorry Staples but I&rsquo;m calling this a fail.</p>
        <p>(as soon as I can find the ad online I&rsquo;ll link to it)</p>
