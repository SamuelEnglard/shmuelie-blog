<p>For those that have been following me on Twitter I&rsquo;ve been working on porting XNA code to MonoGame. So far its been going pretty well. I&rsquo;ve had some problems and I hope to blog about them (at the <a href="https://twitter.com/lancewmccarthy/status/296713704932794368" target="_blank">request of Lance McCarthy</a> I admit). One I just came was with resource files. Because we have plans to translate the text in the app to different cultures besides English US eventually I made use of .NET resources files. In my MonoGame port I&rsquo;m linking to the same code files to I add the files as links to the base files in MonoDevelop. I went to compile and the compiler couldn&rsquo;t find the class that the resource file creates to allow access to the localized strings. There were no errors in the resources backing class so I was stumped. On a whim I decided to look at the Build Action for the resource class and RESX files and there was the answer! Both were set to &ldquo;BundleResource&rdquo; not &ldquo;Compile&rdquo;. Switched both of them and BOOM it worked!</p>
