        <p>In one of my many attempts to make my Windows 7 laptop boot quicker I came up with a crazy idea: Disable the floppy driver. My laptop doesn&rsquo;t have one nor did I expect to ever attach one to it. Figured Windows would boot a bit quicker from not needing to spend the time loading that driver. Well a BSOD later I learnt that Windows does need its floppy drive to boot. Luckily System Restore saved me.</p>
        <p>In theory I could have spent the time figuring out why Windows needed its floppy driver to boot but to be honest I doubt the boot speed up would be worth the time I&rsquo;d spend on it. And now Windows 8 boots so fast I don&rsquo;t care!</p>
