        <p>Today I ran intoÂ an interesting problem. A controller with two methods that take the same parameters and both should be GETs. After going crazy I decided to try using ActionVerbs attribute to set a method for a custom, made up HTTP method (called REMAINING) and to my shock it worked!</p>
        <p>Now I know it isn&rsquo;t really REST now but to be honest what is? So I say use this!</p>
