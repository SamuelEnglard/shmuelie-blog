        <p>In Windows 8 Microsoft made the choice to make the Operating System &ldquo;Metro First&rdquo; by replacing the Start Menu with the Start ScreenÂ (and starting to move other things). You can still use the Desktop but you get there from a Metro world. The reason for this was so that developers would make Metro apps since otherwise they&rsquo;d just stick to desktop apps, killing Metro (aka tablets).</p>
        <p>In Windows 8.1 they will be bringing back the Start Button, not the Start Menu. While the merits of doing that are debatable I propose a different idea. I say give us a &ldquo;Desktop First&rdquo; mode in addition to what we currently have.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Desktop First&rdquo; mode would have a Windows 7 like Start Menu with the ability to launch Metro apps. Since you could still use them on Desktop developers would still have reason to make them. Maybe even more since desktop uses will be more likely to get 8 instead of 7 where they can&rsquo;t run Metro at all!</p>
        <p>So you would have these two modes: &ldquo;Desktop First&rdquo; for those who are in a none touch environment or just want to use the desktop and &ldquo;Metro First&rdquo; for tablets and other environments where the Desktop doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
        <p>There is a flaw in this I admit. Primarily that if Paul Thurrott is right and Metro is the future than why spend the resources helping the past.</p>
