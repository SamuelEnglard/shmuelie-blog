<p>For servers the big thing is to have scripts that you just hit go and it sets up the server for you. After thinking about it I figured why can&rsquo;t I have this for my machines. My setup is predictable and should be scriptable. </p><p>At first I was going to do it all in PowerShell but I&rsquo;m no PowerShell genius and I quickly hit road blocks. After a week or two of trying to get past the road blocks I realized that the solution was ScriptCS.</p><p>ScriptCS is a project that allows you to use C# as a scripting language. This was exactly what I needed. So now I used PowerShell to install ScriptCS and then it would run C# Script files using ScriptCS that would install things for me.</p><p>So far I&rsquo;ve got SysInternals and Visual Studio Installation scripts. Working on more. Hopefully sooner than later I&rsquo;ll have the whole process done!<br /></p>
