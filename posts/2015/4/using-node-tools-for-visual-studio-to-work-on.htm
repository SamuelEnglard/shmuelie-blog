<p>I join the <a href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/generator-csharp" target="_blank">generator-csharp</a> open-source project. It&rsquo;s a great project and I&rsquo;m proud to be a maintainer. Being that my favorite IDE is Visual Studio and I had just heard that the Node Tools for Visual Studio had just hit 1.0 I thought I had a great setup. Installed the tools, created a NodeJs project around the source code. </p><p>Only one problem, the tools are designed to help you debug a server project really. After poking around a bit I came across a solution.Â First you right-click on the NodeJs project and go to the projects properties screen. On that screen is a text field for the path to Node.exe. Instead though if you have that point at the launcher for your project it will start up your project in fully interactive mode. Need to pass arguments? Just enter them in the text field for Node.exe arguments.</p><p>In my case the tool I need to launch was <a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">yo</a> and it was in fact the argument that would load my code.</p>
