Despite being in the computer world for some time I’ve never really blogged…the closest being articles I write for dotTech.org. While I do like write there I cant just write crazy concepts or ideas I have that might not be finished…or as my title says when I need to rant about something. But first I thought I’d give a bit of a background on me.    <p>So first things first, My name is Shmueli or Samuel, which ever you can pronounce. On many forums, and even here in my blog’s title I’m known as Bill Gates II. This started out as a joke amongst my friends that I was going to be the next Bill Gates, in a good way of course. I continued to use that name because besides liking it a bit (Ego boost!) it allowed me to connect all my postings across the Web. </p>  <p>Now for my credentials. Those of you who know me know that my specialties are in Microsoft technologies. <em>ASP.NET, WPF, ADO.NET, WinForms, MSSQL, and Silverlight</em>. If it’s a Microsoft technology I most likely know it. Not shockingly I am Microsoft Certified as well. I mostly program in <em>Visual C#, but I also know Visual Basic, Java, JavaScript, (X)HTML, and XML</em>.</p>  <p>If you’re reading this most likely you’re a geek so I’ll also give the specs for my primary computer:</p>  <ul><li>ASUS G73JH </li>    <li>Intel i7 Q740 (1.73GHz, 4 core 8 thread) </li>    <li>6 GB RAM </li>    <li>EAX Advance HD 4.0 </li>    <li>Windows 7 Ultimate x64 </li>    <li>ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5870 (1GB GRAM, 700MHz Clock, 1000MHz GRAM) </li>    <li>500 GB 7200RPM Primary, 640 GB 5400RPM Secondary. </li>    <li>DVD-ML RW </li>    <li>Gigabit Ethernet </li>    <li>Intel a/b/g/n Wi-Fi </li>    <li>Intel WiMAX </li>    <li>2MP Webcam </li>    <li>4 USB 2.0 </li>    <li>1 HDMI </li>    <li>1 VGA </li>    <li>SD Reader </li> </ul><p>Guess that’s it for now.</p>
